        // I had learned how to display a string one letter at a time one line at a time. I figured out how to do this by looking up tutorials and using ChatGPT allowed by Melissa this one time.
        //What my code does is that it asks the user for a string input. When the string input is given, Java then seperates the string by letter. Once it has done that, it prints each letter on a seperate line.
        //I picked the for loop condition to be an "input string length" because the input isn't an integer. An integer requires hard boundries while a string is very varied in it's max words.
